"""Render many chapters at once, resumably.

    python -m abible run [BOOK...] [--workers 5] [--force]

Chapters run in parallel (the Fish account allows 5 requests at a time; each
chapter's scenes go one after another). A chapter whose MP3 and timings exist
is skipped unless --force. Progress goes to .cache/out/kjv/progress.log and
failures to .cache/out/kjv/failures.json; run again to retry them (renders
already returned by Fish are cached and cost nothing).
