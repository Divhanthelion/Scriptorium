"""The cast: one voice for every speaker in the script.

audio/cast/cast.json is generated from the script and Glyssen's character
details; it keeps whatever was decided before (briefs written by hand in
principals.json, Fish voice ids, the chosen design candidate). Casting keys
are what a line is voiced as: line["as"] if set, else line["who"].

Policies (audio/cast/policy.json):
  - "(old)" variants share their character's voice, with the delivery saying
    the age, so a voice ages instead of being recast ("(child)" and
    "(young)" get voices of their own age);
  - "A/B" keys spoken together are led by A (or by FCBH's choice, "as");
  - the narrator lines of chosen books can be read by the book's author
    ("author_voices"), as the Word of Promise recording did for the letters.
