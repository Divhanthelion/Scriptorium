"""Making the cast's voices: Voice Design -> candidates -> one chosen -> a
private Fish voice from that one clip (about 10 s, so 20 voices fit in a
request; see docs/fish-audio.md).

Every candidate reads a line the character really says in the KJV (150
characters at most), so the audition is in character. Candidates are kept in
.cache/voices/<slug>/ with what produced them. Choosing:
  - principal characters (hand-written briefs): the owner listens and picks
    (`voices audition` writes the page; `voices choose KEY N` records it);
  - everyone else: automatically, the candidate that said its line correctly
    and is least like every voice already cast (speaker embeddings), with a
    hard floor so no two voices in one book are near-identical.
