//! Streaming chat for the app's Bible-study assistant. Three wire formats cover the
//! services people use: OpenAI-compatible (OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Groq, and
//! local servers such as vLLM, Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp), Anthropic, and Gemini.
//!
//! Requests run in Rust, not the web page, so API keys never reach page scripts and
//! local servers on the user's network are reachable from every platform.
//!
//! The model can be given tools ([`converse`]): it asks for something, the app looks
//! it up, and the model carries on with what it found, a few rounds at most, all in
//! one answer.
