//! Aligning one translation's verses with the KJV's, by what they say.
//!
//! Translations number verses differently: the Douay-Rheims follows the Vulgate's
//! Psalms, the Septuagint orders Jeremiah differently, Jewish editions count Psalm
//! titles as verses, some translations join, split, swap, or leave out verses. An
//! English translation's verse can be matched to its KJV counterpart by content: the
//! distinctive words they share (names, numbers, rarer words). (Two translations in
//! another language can be compared the same way; one can't be compared with the KJV,
//! and is aligned by kjv-import's align::by_numbers.)
//!
//! Two stages:
//! 1. [`align_blocks`] lines the verses up in order (a sequence alignment allowing
//!    one-to-one matches, joins of two verses, and verses with no counterpart, with a
//!    small preference for verses that carry the same number: [`align`]), keeps what
//!    strong, consecutive matches anchor, and lines up what is left again, as often as
//!    that finds more: each pass recovers another block of text printed in another
//!    order (the Septuagint's Jeremiah, Proverbs, and Exodus 35-40) or in a related
//!    book (Nehemiah as the Septuagint's Ezra 11-23).
//! 2. [`refine`] keeps the matches the content supports, splits joins whose halves
//!    don't both match, and pairs whatever is left by best similarity anywhere in the
//!    book and its related books (single verses moved, additions printed elsewhere);
//!    last of all, leftovers with the same number on both sides are paired "by number".
//!
//! Every group carries how it was matched, so the alignment tables can be reviewed.
